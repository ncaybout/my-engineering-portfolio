        <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Me</h1>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px; font-size: 18px;">
    I'm Nadim Aybout, a dedicated Mechanical Engineer specializing in mechanical design, problem-solving, and project management. I am currently pursuing my degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo, where I have gained a solid foundation in engineering principles. My passion lies in tackling complex engineering challenges and delivering innovative solutions.<br>
    <br>
    With hands-on experience in manufacturing processes, 3D modeling, CAD design, as well as basic robotics, I have developed a well-rounded skill set. My work with companies like EJS Engineering, Colortech, and Toyota has allowed me to refine my expertise in areas such as mechanical analysis, product development, and quality assurance. I am confident in my ability to approach projects with precision and efficiency.<br>
    <br>
    Beyond academics, I am an active member of the UW Formula Electric and Rocketry clubs, where I collaborate with fellow engineers to design and build advanced systems. My involvement in these clubs has enhanced my teamwork and technical skills, while also fueling my enthusiasm for pushing the boundaries of innovation.<br>
    <br>
    Driven by a commitment to continuous learning, I stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field. I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to projects that require creativity, technical acumen, and a strong work ethic.
